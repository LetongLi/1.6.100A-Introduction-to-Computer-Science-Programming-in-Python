Refers to the process of translating a well-defined algori

## Complexity of the first bisection method
Other steps of the method can be considered constants.

## Bisection search alternative
Simply remember the location of the piece instead of copying the half list.


# Example of logarithmic search

# Comparison of iterative and recursion search
Both are in the O(n) level. Recursion(need to set up the frame) may be a bit slow yet they have the same order of growth.

# Exponetial complexity
