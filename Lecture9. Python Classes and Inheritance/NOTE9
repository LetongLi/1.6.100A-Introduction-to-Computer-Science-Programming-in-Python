name = type (of the class)

how to define a class
how to create an instance

getters and setters methods

Information hiding
python is not good about hiding information
allows to access data from outside class definition
print(a.age)
allows to write data from outside class definition
a.age = "infinite"
allows to create data attributes for an instance from outside class definition
a.size = "tiny"

default arguments(Revisit later?)
can be overwritten later, avoid possible error

Inheritance
Parent class: super class
Child class: sub class
inherits all data and behaviors from parent class, adds more info, adds more behaviors, and overrides behaviors.
if a parent has _init_, a child class may not need one

Bring in other methods
