## len()
len() is a function used to retrieve the length of the string in the parentheses
Example:

## Indexing
square brackets used to perform indexing into a string to get the value at a certain index/position

## Slice strings: [start:stop:step]
1. can slice strings using [start:stop:step]
2. if give two numbers, [start:stop], step=1 by default
3. you can also omit numbers and leave just colons
Example:

4. strings are “immutable” – cannot be modified

## STRINGS AND LOOPS
range is a way to iterate over numbers, but a for loop variable can iterate over any set of values, not just numbers!
